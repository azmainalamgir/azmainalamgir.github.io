<div class="bio">
<p>I was originally born in Bangladesh but spent most of my formative years in
the state of Mississippi, home of the blues and land of the best fried catfish
known to man.</p>
<p>Growing up in the Deep South, I’ve always found myself questioning how
things worked. Why is the sky blue? How did the universe come to be? When will
Arsenal (my favorite football club) win the league again? Although teachers and
textbooks did an adequate job of answering some of these questions on a
superficial level, I still yearned for a deeper understanding for things that
were unknown to me. A pivotal moment came during high school when I began doing
research at a local university near my hometown. By putting myself in the shoes
of a scientist, I discovered how new knowledge can be uncovered through a
formalized process consisting of experimentation and observation. This
experience was precisely what I was looking for to quell my inquisitive
tendencies and sparked my initial desire to pursue a career in research.</p>
<p>After high school, I attended Northwestern University for my undergraduate
studies, where I majored in Chemical Engineering and was fortunate to gain my
first full-blown research experience in the lab of Dr. Milan Mrksich. As part of
the Mrksich lab, I worked on designing a label-free platform for the
high-throughput analysis of small molecules, which subsequently became the
subject of my Honors Thesis. Outside of class, I served on the Executive Board
of the Northwestern chapter of American Institute of Chemical Engineers and as a
tutor (funded by the Federal Work Study Program) for several classes.</p>
<p>My academic and research activities eventually brought me to Cornell
University, where I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering. My
goal at Cornell is to acquire the necessary skills so that I may fulfill my
long-held desire of becoming an independent researcher. I will be periodically
updating this website as my research projects progress, so be sure to check back
later to see how I’d doing!</p>
<p>When I’m not in the lab, you can catch me at the gym pumping iron, in my bed
napping, on the fields playing soccer, or on my couch binging Netflix.</p>
