  <h1>Research Activites</h1>
  <p>Over the years, I've been involved in a number of research projects in
disciplines ranging from chemistry, materials science, and engineering. Listed
below is a timeline of my reserach activities, along with brief descriptions for
each project (please refer to CV for full list of publications and
presentations). </p>

  <h2>Sept. 2016-June 2019</h2>
  <h3>Mrksich Lab</h3><br /><h3><font color="gray"><b>Northwestern University</b></font></h3>
  <p><b>Description:</b> In the fall of 2016, I joined Dr. Milan Mrksich’s lab
  after developing a newfound interest in organic chemistry from my
  undergraduate coursework. I partnered with a graduate student to help develop
  a label-free photochemical platform for rapidly analyzing small molecules
  using SAMDI-MS (Self-Assembled Monolayers Matrix Assisted Laser
  Desorption/Ionization – Mass Spectroscopy), a tool developed by the Mrksich
  group for analyzing surface reactions and capturing analytes in solution
  through the use of functionalized alkanethiolates on gold surfaces. During the
  period that I worked (including two consecutive summers at Northwestern), I was
  able to demonstrate the non-selectivity of a diazirine photochemical probe for
  the immobilization of various small molecules as well as apply this
  photo-immobilization technique to characterize the activity of a cytochrome
  p450 enzyme and to monitor a Suzuki-Miyaura chemical coupling reaction. </p>

  <h2>June 2016-Aug. 2016</h2>
  <h3>Ray Lab</h3><br /><h3><font color="gray"><b>Jackson State University</b></font></h3>
  <p><b>Description:</b> Funded by an NSF PREM Fellowship, I worked as an
undergraduate research assistant in the lab of Dr. Paresh at Jackson State
University during the summer of 2016. The goal of the project I collaborated on
involved the synthesis of hydrochar and biochar (highly functionalized
carbon-based materials) from cellulose and the characterization of those
materials using UV-Vis, Fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy. This work was
later expanded to water purification studies and ultimately led to a publication
in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>

  <h2>2014-2015</h2>
  <h3>Leszczynski Lab</h3><br /><h3><font color="gray"><b>Jackson State University</b></font></h3>
  <p><b>Description:</b> As a high school research assistant, I worked at Jackson
State University in Dr. Jerzy Leszczynski’s lab, where I was involved in a
project related to the synthesis and application of anion-binding receptors.
During this period, I was specifically tasked with conducting spectroscopic
studies via UV-Vis and Fluorescence spectroscopy as well as performing
theoretical binding studies using computational tools to quantitatively
determine binding affinity of the synthesized receptors with environmentally
relevant anions. This work was presented at regional scientific conferences and
local science fairs.</p>
